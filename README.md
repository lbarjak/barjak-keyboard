# Barjak keyboard
code: László Barják 2020

## Description
Barjak keyboard is an [isomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphic_keyboard) musical keyboard layout designed by András Barják. It uses triangles to provide its note layout instead of the more common square-based or hexagonal patterns.

## History and motivation
András Barják has been obsessed with the possibilities of isomorphic keyboards since his childhood. He is an owner of an [Axis 49 midi controller](https://www.c-thru-music.com/cgi/?page=prod_axis-49), and mostly been playing the [Wicki-Hayden layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki%E2%80%93Hayden_note_layout) (also known as Jammer layout). As a young pianist, he was interested in the [Jankó keyboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jank%C3%B3_keyboard), and, as a guitar player, he tried several isomorphic tunings (ie. [tritone tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented-fourths_tuning)).

The [Hexiano app](https://github.com/lrq3000/hexiano), which offered both layouts mapped to a hexagonal pattern on Android platform, provided great motivation for him.

The [Wicki-Hayden layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki%E2%80%93Hayden_note_layout) offers great improvisational possibilities for diatonic music (including folk, pop, rock, modal jazz), while the [Jankó layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jank%C3%B3_keyboard) comes very handy for playing chromatic music (jazz, contemporary classical). However, their advantages and disadvantages are almost mutually exclusive: the ergonomic modal playability of the [Wicki-Hayden layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki%E2%80%93Hayden_note_layout) comes at the price of sacrificing chromatic playability, while conventional diatonic or tonal music is considered to be harder to play on the [Jankó layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jank%C3%B3_keyboard).

The Barjak layout was born as an attempt to combine the strengths of both layouts into a single one.

## Advantages
* All fingering patterns are consistent and easy to transpose
* Ergonomic accessibility of 4th, 5th and 8th intervals
* Diatonic scales are always accessible on triangles of similar direction without the need to move the hand horizontally
* Chromatic ornamentations and accidental passing tones are easily available
* Chromatic playing is still easier compared to traditional piano keyboard layout

## Disadvantages
* More complex than [Wicki-Hayden layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicki%E2%80%93Hayden_note_layout)
* Mistakes might sound more dissonant compared to other layouts
